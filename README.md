# Chinchilib

A rust *hommage* to the [Bunny Library](https://github.com/Damdoshi/LibLapin) designed for teaching the fundamentals of graphical programming, such as how to place a pixel and draw lines when given an array of memory that will rendered to screen.

It's mostly a wrapper arround pixels and winit that takes care of refresh rate, and keeps track of a set of pressed keys.

# Usage
